## 1. System Overview & Core Capabilities

The Enterprise ERP system is built for multi-branch retail, wholesale, and ISP operations. Key highlights include:

- **Dual Nepali Fiscal Calendar (BS & AD)**: Native support for Bikram Sambat (2080, 2081 BS) and Gregorian dates.
- **Device Serial & ONU Tracking**: Track individual hardware serial numbers from intake through customer installation and returns.
- **5-Tier Governance & Approvals**: Financial refunds, stock write-offs, and device replacements require mandatory manager approval.
- **Fiscal Year Closing Lock**: 5-step closing wizard that freezes ledgers and rolls balances forward into the new fiscal period.
